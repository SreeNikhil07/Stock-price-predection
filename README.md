Overview
Provide a brief introduction to the project and its goals. Mention the specific stock(s) you are predicting and the time period for which the predictions are made.

Model Architecture
Describe the architecture of your prediction model. Include details such as:

Model Type: Whether itâ€™s a regression model, time series forecasting model, neural network, etc.
Features Used: Important features or indicators used for prediction (e.g., historical prices, trading volumes, technical indicators, news sentiment).
Model Training: How the model was trained (e.g., data preprocessing steps, normalization, feature selection).
Data
Explain the data used to train and test the model:

Data Source: Where the data came from (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Quandl API, proprietary data).
Time Period: The range of dates covered by the data.
Data Preprocessing: Steps taken to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
